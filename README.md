OpenGL Milky Way 
===========================================================================

![Milky Way](screenshot.png) 

This is an example project to show how to render a Galaxy in OpenGL on the iPhone. 
To simulate interstellar dust realistically with unsorted point sprites in OpenGL, I've implemented a GPU based ray tracing algorithm.
This Milky Way model is used in the [Exoplanet App](http://exoplanetapp.com). 
The Exoplanet App is available for free on the AppStore and contains several other datasets.

I gave a talk about this project at the New York iOS Meetup in January 2013. The [slides](https://github.com/hannorein/OpenGLMilkyWay/raw/master/2012%20NY%20iOS%20Meetup.pdf) of the talk are included in this repository. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions for improvements, please send me an e-mail: exoplanet@hanno-rein.de.
