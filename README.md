OpenGL Milky Way 
===========================================================================

![Milky Way](/hannorein/OpenGLMilkyWay/raw/master/MilkyWayIcon@2x.png) 

This is an example project to show how to render a Galaxy in OpenGL on the iPhone. 
To simulate interstellar dust realistically with unsorted point sprites in OpenGL, I've implemented a GPU based ray tracing algorithm.
This Milky Way model is used in the [Exoplanet App](http://exoplanetapp.com).
